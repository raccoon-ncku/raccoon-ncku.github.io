Workspace Raccoon offers consultants for computational design, simulation, and digital fabrication.
We use Python as our primary programming language, and we're confident to help you establish a computational workflow in Python.

Besides, questions regarding these tools are welcome as we also use them to some extent:
* C# (Rhino/Grasshopper API)

* C++ (Arduino, Robot Operating System)
* JavaScript
* git
* Docker
* Mastercam / NX CAM / Cura
