### Concept

Timber Flow is a project collaborated with Bio Architecture Formosana. It's a series of furniture located in a common room of Shalun Smart Green Energy Science City, Tainan. Benches and pony walls are arranged throughout the room, dividing the space into various places. Uniquely, these elements merge into a single body, where irregular undulations are engineered for sitting and space dividing.
Rather than milling the form out of solid timber blocks, the architects carved out a strategy emphasizing reducing material costs. Wood planks are stacked in a brick pattern with maximized horizontal gaps, allowing light to penetrate through. We analyzed the surface curvature and computed the optimal length of each timber plank. Consequently, this project contains thousands of unique blocks with varying cuttings. Designers proposed a robotic assembly sequence to fabricate these blocks without printing piles of drawings. As a result, it becomes a hollow structure that costs only 25% of materials compared to a CNC milling approach. In this way, Timber Flow is a product of computational design and fabrication, acting as a robust demonstration of intelligent construction.
