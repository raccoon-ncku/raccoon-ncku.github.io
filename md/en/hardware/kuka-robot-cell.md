## KUKA Robot Cell
![KUKA Robot Cell](/assets/img/hardware/kuka_kr300_west.jpg)
### Overview
Developed for the manufacturing industry as process-agnostic positioning devices industrial robots are highly flexible machines capable of quickly introducing precision and repeatability to a near-infinite number of processes. Current research into their architectural implications leverage this notion, interrogating the expanded intersection of the material and formal domains allowed through their use. Raccoon has two robotic workcells at its disposal: the first contains two KUKA KR300 industrial robots mounted on linear axes; there are also two Hiwin robots mounted on mobile platforms beside the KUKA robot cell.

### Access Procedure
The use of each robot varies from semester to semester as coursework and research projects change in scope and application. Due to the time associated with learning to the use the robots, their use is primarily limited to projects associated with dedicated coursework taught by Raccoon team. If you have an individual job that you feel requires the robots, contact the Raccoon staff to discuss the application and possible next steps.

### Use and scheduling
Students and faculty planning to use the work cells need to coordinate with the Raccoon staff for scheduling and/or integration of potential tooling. All approved courses and research projects are required to use the following calendars to schedule time on the robots:
* [East robot schedule](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_ts4eu8j65cggbhnt1vfvhhq5cg@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Asia/Taipei)
