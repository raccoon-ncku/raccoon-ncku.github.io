## HIWIN Robot Cell

### Overview
Developed for the manufacturing industry as process-agnostic positioning devices industrial robots are highly flexible machines capable of quickly introducing precision and repeatability to a near-infinite number of processes. Current research into their architectural implications leverage this notion, interrogating the expanded intersection of the material and formal domains allowed through their use. Raccoon has two robotic workcells at its disposal: the first contains two KUKA KR300 industrial robots mounted on linear axes; there are also two Hiwin robots mounted on mobile platforms beside the KUKA robot cell.

### Access Procedure
The access procedure to the HIWIN robots is still WIP.
