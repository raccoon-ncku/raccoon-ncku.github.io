## 3D Printer
![3D-Printing](/assets/img/hardware/3dp.jpg)
3D printers could create a physical object from a three-dimensional digital model, typically by laying down many thin layers of a material in succession.

### Access Procedure
* Please follow the [General Terms of Use](https://raccoon-ncku.github.io/pages/info/internal-general-terms.html) and the terms listed on this page.
* Prepare your model by following the instructions in the **File Preparation** section.
* Bring your 3D model to Raccoon, and discuss the slicing detail with the lab assistants.
* Calculate the printing fee and pay
* Once the printing is finished, assistants will notify you to collect the print parts.

### Material
The printing material is limited to white PLA provided by Raccoon.

### Dimensional Limitations
L250 x W210 x H410 mm

### File Preparation
1. Check if the geometry is closed.
2. Check if the thinnest part is not smaller than 0.8 mm. Otherwise, it won't be printed, or it might lead to a poor printing result.
3. When necessary, split the geometry into multiple parts, and orient the parts to their ideal printing direction.
4. Arrange the printing parts on the printing bed. Concentrating the arrangement could reduce the traverse time of the print head, thus reducing the total print time.
5. Export the geometry as STL or OBJ format.

### Pricing
If not specified otherwise, the assistant will use the latest CURA with the following settings to calculate the material usage.

* layer height 0.2 mm
* No support and raft
* 2 walls
* 10% infill

The fee is calculated with the following rate:
* Current students and faculty of Dept. of Arch: NTD $2 per gram.
* Current students and faculty of NCKU, Alumni of Dept. of Arch: NTD $3 per gram.
* Other: NTD $5 per gram.

### 
1. If a failure-prone problem of the geometry is identified by the assistants beforehand, yet the user insists to go on printing, the material used by the failed printing will then be charged.
3. Consulting the lab assistant before printing will be very helpful if you have no experience in 3D printing.
