## Laser Cutter
![laser_cutter](/assets/img/hardware/laser-cutter.jpg)
Laser Cutter focuses laser beams on the surface of the material, cutting the material by vaporizing it.
The workspace operates two laser cutter systems for CPD faculty and students. All of them are located in the laser cutter room, on the northwest basement of the architecture building.

### Access Procedure
* Please follow the [General Terms of Use](https://raccoon-ncku.github.io/pages/info/internal-general-terms.html) and the terms listed on this page.
* Please check your material and cutting geometry meet the machine limitations.
* Fill out the form below to reserve a time slot no later than 17:00 on the day before cutting.
* To cancel a reservation, please email the assistant before 23:00 on the day before cutting.
* Bring **material**, **cutting files**, **cash** at the reserved time.
* Please arrive at the cutter room on time. The assistant will only wait for 15min, then the reservation will be canceled if no show.
* The assistants reserve the right to reject cutting geometries that are not suitable for cutting.
* If there is no one reserving the next time slot, one could keep cutting after the reservation.
* Please help the assistant to restore and clean the laser cutter room after cutting.

### Material
* Acrylic =< 10 mm
* Paperboard =< 3 mm
* Chipboard or MDF =< 6 mm

Please prepare a flat material for cutting. A warped material that doesn't fit the machine couldn't be cut.
Please do not the mixed acrylic with ABS, cutting such material will be charged a cleaning fee of NTD $500.

### Dimensional Limitations
* Machine A : 812.8 x 457.2 mm
* Machine B : 609.6 x 457.2 mm

### File Preparation
1. File Format：3DM/DWG/DXF
2. Delete overlapping lines.
3. Black(R:0/G:0/B:0) for engraving, set the line width to the desired value.
4. Red(R:255/G:0/B:0) for cutting, leave the line width as default(0 mm).
5. Green(R:0/G:255/B:0) for reference lines, and it will be skipped during operation. It is meant for material boundaries or cut geometries.
6. Please draw the material boundaries on the green layer, and arrange your cutting geometries in it.

### Machine Rate
* up to 5 mm: NTD $5/min
* above 5 mm, up to 7 mm: NTD $7/min
* above 7 mm: NTD $10/min

The fee is calculated with the machine's operation time.
The cutting time will prolong on older machines, so using the old machine for cutting will receive a 70% off.

### Reservation Request
Please fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfb7LfBw3krto0ne0Xhq992D16tcGEgtaDMYD9pogVkKNA3yg/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&flr=0) to reserve the machine.

ATTENTION: You will receive TWO conformation emails after submitting the form. The first is a confirmation mail that the system has received your request and there is no reservation conflict. Once the assistant has reviewed the request, you will receive the second email. Any further notification, such as rescheduling or file problems, will be sent to you with emails.
