            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>RAC-Coon operates one 3-axis CNC routers. The machines has a 2400 x 1200mm work envelope with 300mm of
                Z-axis clearance. They perform both 2D profiling of flat sheet stock and 3D surface machining of solid
                materials including wood and foam.</P>
            <h3>Access Procedure</h3>
            <p>The 3-axis routers are operated by trained Lab Assistants on a set schedule that varies by semester.
                Please consult the RAC-Coon website for access to the current CNC lab assitant calendar when planning
                any
                router work.</p>
            <h3>File Preparation</h3>
            <p>Our CAM software (RhinoCAM 2016) is CAM plugin for Rhino 6. For most
                purposes all geometries should be submitted as Rhinoceros 3DM files. Please set the origin and
                orientation of the file according to the diagram below. It is also helpful to model an outline of the
                stock to be milled in addition to the design geometries.
                Although the machine can move within the limits outlined above, the design of the 3D surface being
                milled (steepness, curvature, etc.) and the limitations of the tools (limited depth of the bits,
                potential collision with the tool holder, etc.) affect the feasability of milling. These factors impact
                the Z-axis travel almost exclusively, and students are advised to keep their maximum material size at
                2400 x 1200 x 10mm.</p>
            <h3>Talk with a Coordinating Lab Assistant</h3>
            <p>Think of the Coordinating Lab Assistant as an advisor for your CNC project. The Coordinating Lab
                Assistants hold regular office-hours in both the Workplace RAC-Coon and the design studio to meet with
                anyone
                seeking to use
                the CNC machines. To speak with the Coordinating Lab Assistant look at their office-hours posted on the
                Scheduling LA Calendar on the RAC-Coon website; you can contact them via emailing at
                taubmancollegerouter@
                website to request an appointment during an available time slot. The Coordinating LA will reply to
                confirm the appointment. If the calendar is full, you may also try stopping by the RAC-Coon during
                scheduled office-hours.
                Bring your file(s) to the appointment with the Coordinating Lab Assistant. They will review your
                geometry, discuss material choices and answer any questions you may have. At the end of the appointment,
                the Coordinating Lab Assistant will work with you to schedule a cut time with a Lab Assistant on the CNC
                Calendar (also available on the RAC-Coon website).</p>
            <h3>Material Preparation</h3>
            <p>It is important that you handle all material preparation prior to you scheduled shift with a Lab
                Assistant to limit unnecessary delays. This includes material purchase, any lamination that may be
                required, etc. Please see the Material Selection Guidelines and Solid Block Preparation sections below
                for further information on material preparation.
                If you are planning on using a non-standard material please consult with the Coordinating Lab Assistants
                or Research Associates. prior to placing your order as specialty router bits may be required. Due to the
                nature of the machinery RAC-Coon reserves the right to refuse the use of any router bits supplied by a
                student.</p>
            <h3>Cut with a Lab Assistant</h3>
            <p>Arrive to your scheduled shift with your prepared file(s) and material. Upon arrival, the Lab Assistant
                will prepare the necessary RhinoCAM files and run your project on the router. If you have prepared your
                Mastercam file yourself the Lab Assistant will review it before cutting to ensure that it has been set
                up properly for the RAC-Coon machines.
                Students are required to be present for the duration of their cut in order to make any necessary
                decisions that could affect the finished piece and to assist the Lab Assistant when neccessary. It is
                recommended that students pay attention to how the Lab Assistant sets up their file and runs the CNC
                router to better understand the limitations of the process.</p>
            <h3>Clean Up and Pay</h3>
            <p>It is the student’s responsibility to clean up after the cut is complete. All scrap material must be
                taken to the dumpster located outside the ___ and all debris/dust must be swept and
                properly discarded. Additional cleaning may be necessary depending on the circumstances of the cut.</p>
            <h3>Safety</h3>
            <p>Please refer to the workplace safety and robot safety sections in the safety page.</p>

            <h3>Pricing</h3>
            <p>Please refer to the workplace safety and robot safety sections in the safety page.</p>
